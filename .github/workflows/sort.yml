To sort the table according to the "#" column on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

Go to your GitHub repository where the markdown file containing the table is located.
Open the markdown file in the repository.
Find the table section in the markdown file.
Copy the contents of the table.
Paste the copied table contents into a GitHub issue or pull request comment.
GitHub will automatically render the table.
Hover over the column header "#" in the rendered table.
Click on the arrow icon that appears next to the "#" column header.
Select "Sort ascending" or "Sort descending" as per your preference.
GitHub will sort the table based on the "#" column accordingly.
Following these steps will allow you to sort the table directly on GitHub.

To automatically sort the table in your README file on GitHub using GitHub Actions, you can create a workflow that parses the README file, sorts the table based on the "#" column, and then commits the changes back to the repository. Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

Create a Workflow File: Create a .github/workflows/sort-table.yml file in your repository.

Define the Workflow: Define the workflow to trigger on a push event and specify the job steps.

yaml
Copy code
name: Sort Table

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust if your main branch is different

jobs:
  sort-table:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install markdown-table

      - name: Sort Table
        run: |
          npx markdown-table -i README.md -s '#' --sort-ascending
          
      - name: Commit Changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "abdul1mannan@example.com"
          git config --local user.name "abdul1mannan"
          git commit -am "Automatically sorted table"
          git push
Adjust Configuration: Modify the workflow file according to your specific requirements. Ensure that the README.md path and the sorting column are correctly specified.

Commit and Push Workflow: Commit the changes to your repository and push them to trigger the workflow.

After setting up this workflow, whenever you push changes to your repository, the workflow will automatically sort the table in your README file based on the "#" column and commit the changes back to the repository with the configured username. Make sure to replace "abdul1mannan@example.com" and "abdul1mannan" with your actual email and GitHub username.

Run npx markdown-table -i README.md -s '#' --sort-ascending
  
npx: installed 1 in 0.552s
command not found: markdown-table
ChatGPT
It seems like the markdown-table package is not installed or not available globally in your environment. Here's how you can install it globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g markdown-table
Once installed globally, you should be able to run the markdown-table command from anywhere in your terminal. Then you can run the command you mentioned:

bash
Copy code
npx markdown-table -i README.md -s '#' --sort-ascending
This command will sort the table in your README.md file based on the "#" column in ascending order. Make sure to replace README.md with the actual path to your README file.

User
add this in abouve workflow
ChatGPT
To integrate the installation of markdown-table into your GitHub Actions workflow, you can modify the workflow file to include a step that installs markdown-table before sorting the table. Here's how you can adjust your workflow file:

yaml
Copy code
name: Sort Table

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust if your main branch is different

jobs:
  sort-table:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install -g markdown-table

      - name: Sort Table
        run: |
          npx markdown-table -i README.md -s '#' --sort-ascending
          
      - name: Commit Changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "mannan.jnv123@gmail.com"
          git config --local user.name "abdul1mannan"
          git commit -am "Automatically sorted table"
          git push
